It's been long since sensors were introduced in the agriculture operations. But the problem with the traditional approach of utilizing sensor technology was that we were not able to get the live data from the sensors. The sensors used to log the data into their attached memory and later on we were able to use it . With the introduction of Industrial IoT in Agriculture, far more advanced sensors are being utilized. The sensors are now connected to the cloud via cellular/satellite network. Which lets us to know the real-time data from the sensors, making decision making effective.
By using the sensor technology data access time reduces which results in efficient increase in efficiency. So in crop monitoring various parameters measurements can be easily done.
Wireless technology in the agriculture plays a vital role for the transmission of the data from one node to another.
